- Third Party APIs: In this assignments we are calling the Nasa API to get different information they offer. The api is called from the backend so in order for this to work we have to start it with "npm start" on the "back" folder. The endpoints we used to make call the api are /apod, /apodbydate, /mars and /neo.
